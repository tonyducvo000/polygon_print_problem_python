polygon_print_problem_python

Additions to the well-known "print a pyramid/triangle with asterisks" problem.  Here, the repo includes solution to print a hexagon and pentagon using asterisk.
Included is a scratch file, where the the asterisks and spacings were manually inputted.  This helped in identifying the pattern needed to implement in order to achieve the solution.
